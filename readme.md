#SunScreenApp

Idea for building this app came when I got annoyed about putting on sun screen when clouds showed up only 10 minutes later.
So then why not have an android app that can provide you actual information about uv intensity, so you can make better decisions!

This app makes use of android geocoding to get a weather forecast from weatherbit api from a prompted location
